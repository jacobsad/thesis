	crucially on how the benefits from cooperation are divided and whether

	these questions by adopting a methodology from economics called mechanism
	design. Focusing on reproductive skew as a case study, we show that
	full cooperation may not be achievable due to private information
	over individuals' outside options, regardless of the details of the
	specific biological or social interaction. Further, we consider how
	the structure of the interaction can evolve to promote the maximum
	amount of cooperation in the face of the informational constraints.
	Our results point to a distinct avenue for investigating how cooperation
	can evolve when the division of benefits is flexible and individuals
	have private information.},

  abstract = {Optimization theory in combination with canopy modeling is potentially
	a powerful tool for evaluating the adaptive significance of photosynthesis-related
	plant traits. Yet its successful application has been hampered by
	a lack of agreement on the appropriate optimization criterion. Here
	we review how models based on different types of optimization criteria
	have been used to analyze traits-particularly N reallocation and
	leaf area indices-that determine photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency
	at the canopy level. By far the most commonly used approach is static-plant
	simple optimization (SSO). Static-plant simple optimization makes
	two assumptions: (1) plant traits are considered to be optimal when
	they maximize whole-stand daily photosynthesis, ignoring competitive
	interactions between individuals; (2) it assumes static plants, ignoring
	canopy dynamics (production and loss of leaves, and the reallocation
	and uptake of nitrogen) and the respiration of nonphotosynthetic
	tissue. Recent studies have addressed either the former problem through
	the application of evolutionary game theory (EGT) or the latter by
	applying dynamic-plant simple optimization (DSO), and have made considerable
	progress in our understanding of plant photosynthetic traits. However,
	we argue that future model studies should focus on combining these
	two approaches. We also point out that field observations can fit
	predictions from two models based on very different optimization
	criteria. In order to enhance our understanding of the adaptive significance
	of photosynthesis-related plant traits, there is thus an urgent need
	for experiments that test underlying optimization criteria and competing
	hypotheses about underlying mechanisms of optimization.},

	the level of cooperation of smaller networks or unstructured populations.
	We have also found that subjects respond to the cooperation that
	they observe in a reciprocal manner, being more likely to cooperate
	if, in the previous round, many of their neighbors and themselves
	did so, which implies that humans do not consider neighbors' payoffs
	when making their decisions in this dilemma but only their actions.
	Our results, which are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions

	defect if the opponent has defected. But TFT has two weaknesses:
	(i) it cannot correct mistakes (erroneous moves) and (ii) a population
	of TFT players is undermined by random drift when mutant strategies
	appear which play always-cooperate (ALLC). Another equally simple
	strategy called 'win-stay, lose-shift' (WSLS) has neither of these

	payoff has met its aspiration level and changes otherwise. Here,
	we use a novel approach of stochastic evolutionary game dynamics

  abstract = {{Objective Traditional cancer initiation theory propounds evolution
	of a monoclonal population of fully transformed tumour cells to form
	a malignant tumour. Cooperation between surrounding stroma and the
	tumour also often leads to malignancy. This cooperation may exist
	as a result of sharing of growth signals or growth factors secreted
	by stromal cells, which can cause those with proliferative phenotypes
	to switch to motile phenotypes. Mathematical models of sharing of
	growth factors between cancer stem cells and stromal cells can allow
	for deeper understanding of tumourigenesis through cooperation. The
	study presented here describes a novel evolutionary game theoretical
	approach to investigate emergence of malignancy through interactions
	among cells of three different phenotypes, one of which produces
	growth factors. Materials and methods Three different scenarios have
	been considered, and types of behaviour of the three phenotypes during
	interactions, have been modelled in terms of cost and benefit variables.
	Phenotypic compositions of such a tumour at equilibrium have been
	analysed, and evolution of the population, with respect to time,
	has been investigated. Results Results suggest the role of cooperation
	in forming a malignant tumour and show, in all three cases, that
	emergence of triple polymorphism, two-strategy polymorphism, and
	fixation of one phenotype, were possible at equilibrium. The models
	also suggest that under certain conditions, one phenotype may be
	completely eliminated from the population, thus leading to new possibilities
	for potential treatments. Conclusions This study explains some current
	experimental findings from a theoretical viewpoint, and may provide
	new approaches for future research in oncology.}},

	differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change
	the nature of a game. Even small amounts of variability can stabilize
	cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters.
	Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction,

	negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than
	unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation
	and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations,
	whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness
	trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that
	a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets,
	so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner,
	variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative
	individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor

  abstract = {Traditionally, theoretical works on the evolution of virulence of
	wildlife infections have focused on interactions between just the
	host and its parasite. In a large number of study cases, however,
	infected host individuals also incur severe mortality due to predation
	of higher trophic levels. Such morality should be virulence-dependent
	since the population size of predators is determined by the available
	amount prey they consume, which, in turn, is a function of pathogen
	virulence. The potential role of trophic pressure by predators in
	the evolution of virulence of their prey remains largely unaddressed
	in the literature. Here we investigate the possible role of predators
	in promoting biodiversity and disruptive evolution (evolutionary
	branching) of pathogen strains infecting the prey that those predators
	consume. Our theoretical study is based on principles of adaptive
	dynamics and evolutionary game theory. With the help of a fairly
	simple model we demonstrate that predation on infected prey can result
	in evolutionary branching of pathogen virulence, which would be impossible
	in the same system without predators. We show that predator-mediated
	evolutionary branching can occur within a large range of species
	life-history traits and for various types of transmission-virulence
	trade-off relation. We argue that predation can play an important

  abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization.
	Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human
	society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish
	replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one
	another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore
	opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here
	I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection,
	direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and
	group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that
	specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

	under which cooperation is favored by natural selection. Effects
	of population structure on the evolution of cooperation have been
	one of the central questions in this issue, and inclusive fitness
	analyses have unveiled two different selective forces that favor
	cooperation; the direct fitness effect to the helper and the indirect
	fitness benefit to the helper via its kin. Although these theoretical
	frameworks have made a significant contribution to our understanding
	of cooperative traits, there is still one factor to be taken into
	account, synergy. Synergy means a nonlinear effect that arises when
	two individuals help each other. In other words, it represents deviation
	from additivity, to which inclusive fitness theory has paid relatively
	little attention. Here I provide a theoretical result on the possibility
	that synergy favors the evolution of cooperation. For homogeneously
	structured populations with non-overlapping generations, I show that
	incorporating synergistic effects does not rescue the evolution of
	cooperation. Potential factors that could enable synergy to rescue

	findings highlight that, if the perceived risk associated to an epidemic
	is sufficiently large, then even a small reduction in the number
	of potentially infectious contacts (as a response to the epidemic)
	can remarkably affect the infection spread. In particular, the earlier
	the warning about the epidemic appears, the larger the possible reduction
	of the peak prevalence, and of the final epidemic size. Moreover,
	the epidemic spread is delayed if individuals' perception of risk
	is based on a memory mechanism and the risk of infection is initially
	overestimated. In conclusion, this analysis allows noteworthy inferences

	we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
	shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We
	also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,
	cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their
	network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different
	outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network
	rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and
	form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate

	confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models

  abstract = {How can cooperation be achieved between self-interested individuals
	in commonly-occurring asymmetric interactions where agents have different
	positions? Should agents use the same strategies that are appropriate
	for symmetric social situations? We explore these questions through
	the asymmetric interaction captured in the indeﬁnitely repeated investment
	game (IG). In every period of this game, the ﬁrst player decides
	how much of an endowment he wants to invest, then this amount is
	tripled and passed to the second player, who ﬁnally decides how much
	of the tripled investment she wants to return to the ﬁrst player.
	The results of three evolutionary studies demonstrate that the best-performing
	strategies for this asymmetric game differ from those for a similar
	but symmetric game, the indeﬁnitely repeated Prisoner’s dilemma game.
	The strategies that enable cooperation for the asymmetric IG react
	more sensitively to exploitation, meaning that cooperation can more
	easily break down. Furthermore, once cooperation has stopped, it
	is much more difﬁcult to reestablish than in symmetric situations.
	Based on these results, the presence of asymmetry in an interaction
	appears to be an important factor affecting adaptive behavior in
	these common social situations.},

	Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative
	society from invasion by free-riders, it cannot always convert a
	society of free-riders to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms,
	cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full
	defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A
	society of free-riders is then caught in a social trap, and the institution
	is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive
	cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by
	institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show
	that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives.
	In particular, optional participation allows institutions punishing
	free-riders to overcome the social dilemma at a much lower cost,
	and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes
	the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators
	cannot be invaded by free-riders, it will necessarily become established
	in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial
	number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides
	a “lighter touch” than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at
	considerably lower cost.},

	of an entity to invest in securing its premises from stochastic risks
	no longer depends solely on its own actions but also on the actions
	of other interacting entities in the system. This phenomenon is commonly
	seen in many domains including airline, logistics and computer security
	and is referred to as Interdependent Security (IDS). An IDS game
	models this decision problem from a game-theoretic perspective and
	deals with the behavioural dynamics of risk-reduction investments
	in such settings. This paper enhances this model and investigates
	the spatio-temporal aspects of the IDS games. The spatio-temporal
	dynamics are studied using simple replicator dynamics on a variety
	of network structures and for various security cost tradeoffs that
	lead to different Nash equilibria in an IDS game. The simulation
	results show that the neighbourhood configuration has a greater effect
	on the IDS game dynamics than network structure. An in-depth empirical
	analysis of game dynamics is carried out on regular graphs, which
	leads to the articulation of necessary and sufficient conditions

	negotiation among selfish individuals, by predicting patterns of
	vigilance in a pair of animals foraging under threat of predation.
	I show that the game played by the animals and the resulting vigilance
	strategies take radically different forms, according to the way predation
	risk is shared in the pair. In particular, if predators choose their
	target at random, the prey respond by displaying moderate vigilance
	and taking turns scanning. By contrast, if the individual that takes
	flight later in an attack endures a higher risk of being targeted,
	vigilance increases and there is always at least one sentinel in
	the pair. Finally, when lagging behind its companion in fleeing from
	an attacker becomes extremely risky, vigilance decreases again and
	the animals scan simultaneously.},

  abstract = {Many long-lived plants such as trees show masting or intermittent

	the dynamics of individual-plant resource budgets, masting occurs
	when the resource depletion coefficient k (ratio of the reproductive
	expenditure to the excess resource reserve) is large. Here, we mathematically
	studied the condition for masting evolution. In an infinitely large
	population, we obtained a deterministic dynamical system, to which
	we applied the pairwise invasibility plot and convergence stability
	of evolutionary singularity analyses. We prove that plants reproducing
	at the same rate every year are not evolutionarily stable. The resource
	depletion coefficient k increases, and the system oscillates with
	a period of 2 years (high and low reproduction) if k < 1. Alternatively,
	k may evolve further and jump to a value >1, resulting in the sudden
	start of intermittent reproduction. We confirm that a high survivorship
	of young plants (seedlings) in the light-limited understory favors
	masting evolution, as previously suggested by computer simulations
	and field observations. The stochasticity caused by the finiteness
	of population size also promotes masting evolution.},

  pages = {1-6},
  abstract = {Evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations provide a new framework
	to understand the selection of traits with frequency-dependent fitness.
	Recently, a simple but fundamental law of evolutionary dynamics,
	which we call sigma law, describes how to determine the selection
	between two competing strategies: in most evolutionary processes
	with two strategies, A and B, strategy A is favored over B in weak
	selection if and only if sigma R + S > T + sigma P. This relationship
	holds for a wide variety of structured populations with mutation
	rate and weak selection under certain assumptions. In this paper,
	we propose a model of games based on a community-structured population
	and revisit this law under the Moran process. By calculating the
	average payoffs of A and B individuals with the method of effective
	sojourn time, we find that sigma features not only the structured
	population characteristics, but also the reaction rate between individuals.
	That is to say, an interaction between two individuals are not uniform,
	and we can take sigma as a reaction rate between any two individuals
	with the same strategy. We verify this viewpoint by the modified
	replicator equation with non-uniform interaction rates in a simplified
	version of the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG).},

	matrix. For calculating these structural coefficients one has to
	investigate games with three strategies, but more are not needed.
	Therefore, n = 3 is the general case. Our main result has a geometric
	interpretation: Strategy selection is determined by the sum of two
	terms, the first one describing competition on the edges of the simplex
	and the second one in the center. Our formula includes all known
	weak selection criteria of evolutionary games as special cases. As
	a specific example we calculate games on sets and explore the synergistic

	when studying the evolution of human cooperation. Direct reciprocity
	is considered to be a powerful mechanism for the evolution of cooperation,
	and it is generally assumed that it can lead to high levels of cooperation.
	Here we explore an open-ended, infinite strategy space, where every
	strategy that can be encoded by a finite state automaton is a possible
	mutant. Surprisingly, we find that direct reciprocity alone does
	not lead to high levels of cooperation. Instead we observe perpetual
	oscillations between cooperation and defection, with defection being
	substantially more frequent than cooperation. The reason for this
	is that “indirect invasions” remove equilibrium strategies: every
	strategy has neutral mutants, which in turn can be invaded by other
	strategies. However, reciprocity is not the only way to promote cooperation.
	Another mechanism for the evolution of cooperation, which has received
	as much attention, is assortment because of population structure.
	Here we develop a theory that allows us to study the synergistic
	interaction between direct reciprocity and assortment. This framework
	is particularly well suited for understanding human interactions,
	which are typically repeated and occur in relatively fluid but not
	unstructured populations. We show that if repeated games are combined
	with only a small amount of assortment, then natural selection favors
	the behavior typically observed among humans: high levels of cooperation
	implemented using conditional strategies.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is ubiquitous in the world surrounding us, from bacteria

	of such social structures not only opens the opportunity of having
	diverse behaviors depending on the individuals' social position,

	the returns obtained from each group. Here, we address these issues
	by studying the evolution of cooperation under Public Goods Games
	in the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory where cooperative players
	are able to distribute their donations to their liking. As a result,
	cooperation is greatly enhanced when the community structure is described
	by homogeneous graphs, as cooperators become able to support cooperative
	groups and retaliate against those with poor achievements by withdrawing
	donations from them. Whenever the underlying network becomes complex
	enough to add diversity to the distribution of group sizes, directed
	investments do not optimize the emergence of cooperation, but they
	do enhance its robustness against the invasion of a minority of free-riders.
	We define a robustness index and show that directed investments expand

  title = {On Modeling of Coevolution of Strategies and Structure in Autonomous
	Overlay Networks},
  journal = {ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {7},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Currently, on one hand, there exist much work about network formation
	and/or growth models, and on the other hand, cooperative strategy
	evolutions are extensively investigated in biological, economic,
	and social systems. Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous,
	dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative
	authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests,
	or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users.
	Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational
	strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches
	that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure
	and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article
	lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates
	the interaction between rational strategies and network structure
	(through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we
	not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy
	over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural
	properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions
	are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost
	ratio (b/c) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The
	critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers
	in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary
	rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according
	to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties
	of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the
	degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent
	is (4-3 upsilon)/(1-3 upsilon), where v is peer's linking mutation
	probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to
	cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will
	evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency
	and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree
	distribution as in the original evolution model.},

	impact of the more rational decision-making of individuals on voluntary
	vaccination. In the first model, individuals are endowed with memory
	capacity for their past experiences of dealing with vaccination.
	In addition to their current payoffs, they also take account of the
	historical payoffs that are discounted by a memory-decaying factor.
	They use such overall payoffs (weighing the current payoffs and historical
	payoffs) to reassess their vaccination strategies. Those who have
	higher overall payoffs are more likely imitated by their social neighbors.
	In the second model, individuals do not blindly learn the strategies
	of neighbors; they also combine the fraction of infection in :he
	past epidemic season. If the fraction of infection surpasses the
	perceived risk threshold, individuals will increase the probability
	of taking vaccination. Otherwise, they will decrease the probability
	of taking vaccination. Then we use evolutionary game theory to study
	the vaccination behavior of people during an epidemiological process.
	To do this, we propose a two-stage model: individuals make vaccination
	decisions during a yearly vaccination campaign, followed by an epidemic
	season. This forms a feedback loop between the vaccination decisions
	of individuals and their health outcomes, and thus payoffs. We find
	that the two more rational decision-making models have nontrivial
	impacts on the vaccination behavior of individuals, and, as a result,
	on the final fraction of infection. Our results highlight that, from
	an individual's viewpoint, the decisions are optimal and more rational.
	However, from the social viewpoint, the strategies of individuals
	can give rise to distinct outcomes. Namely, the rational behavior
	of individuals plays a `double-edged-sword' role on the social effects.},
