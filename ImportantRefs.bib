	crucially on how the benefits from cooperation are divided and whether
	individuals have complete information about their payoffs. We tackle
	these questions by adopting a methodology from economics called mechanism
	design. Focusing on reproductive skew as a case study, we show that
	full cooperation may not be achievable due to private information
	over individuals' outside options, regardless of the details of the
	specific biological or social interaction. Further, we consider how
	the structure of the interaction can evolve to promote the maximum
	amount of cooperation in the face of the informational constraints.
	Our results point to a distinct avenue for investigating how cooperation
	can evolve when the division of benefits is flexible and individuals
	have private information.},

  abstract = {Behaviour is typically regarded as among the most flexible of animal
	phenotypic traits. In particular, expression of cooperative behaviour
	is often assumed to be conditional upon the behaviours of others.
	This flexibility is a key component of many hypothesized mechanisms
	favouring the evol- ution of cooperative behaviour. However, evidence
	shows that cooperative behaviours are often less flexible than expected
	and that, in many species, individuals show consistent differences
	in the amount and type of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviours
	displayed. This phenomenon is known as ‘animal personality’ or a
	‘behavioural syndrome’. Animal personality is evolutionarily relevant,
	as it typically shows heritable variation and can entail fitness
	consequences, and hence, is subject to evolutionary change. Here,
	we review the empirical evidence for individual variation in cooperative
	behaviour across taxa, we examine the evolutionary processes that
	have been invoked to explain the existence of individual variation
	in cooperative behaviour and we discuss the conse- quences of consistent
	individual differences on the evolutionary stability of cooperation.
	We highlight that consistent individual variation in cooperativeness
	can both stabilize or disrupt cooperation in populations. We conclude
	that recognizing the existence of consistent individual differences
	in cooperativeness is essential for an understanding of the evolution
	and prevalence of cooperation.},

	‘beyond the dyad’. The concepts of by-product mutualism and pseudo-reciprocity
	force us to think again about our basic definitions of cooperative

	outcome of an interaction between two or more individuals). Reciprocity
	is surprisingly rare outside of humans, even among large-brained

	that strategies that succeed with fixed exchanges (e.g., Tit-for-Tat)
	cannot explain mutualism when exchanges vary because the amount exchanged
	evolves to 0. For mutualism to evolve, increased investments in a
	partner must yield increased returns, and spatial structure in competitive
	interactions is required. Under these biologically plausible assumptions,
	mutualism evolves with surprising ease. This suggests that, contrary

	dishonesty at evolutionarily stable frequencies under some ecological

	the problem beautifully in light of the logic of natural selection.
	Hamilton and Williams delivered the necessary satisfaction by appealing
	to kinship, and Trivers showed that kinship was not necessary as
	long as the originally altruistic act was conditionally reciprocated.
	From the late 1970s to the present, the kinship theories in particular
	have been supported by considerable empirical data and elaborated
	to explore a number of other social interactions such as cooperation,
	selfishness and punishment, giving us what is now a rich description
	of the nature of social relationships among organisms. There are,
	however, two forms of theoretically possible social interactions—reciprocity
	and spite—that appear absent or nearly so in non-human vertebrates,
	despite considerable research efforts on a wide diversity of species.
	We suggest that the rather weak comparative evidence for these interactions
	is predicted once we consider the requisite socioecological pressures
	and psychological mechanisms. That is, a consideration of ultimate
	demands and proximate prerequisites leads to the prediction that
	reciprocity and spite should be rare in non-human animals, and common
	in humans. In particular, reciprocity and spite evolved in humans
	because of adaptive demands on cooperation among unrelated individuals
	living in large groups, and the integrative capacities of inequity
	detection, future-oriented decision-making and inhibitory control.},

	defect if the opponent has defected. But TFT has two weaknesses:
	(i) it cannot correct mistakes (erroneous moves) and (ii) a population

	individuals are often ignored. In particular, when analysing the

	variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution
	when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate,
	differences are not innocuous noise, but can fundamentally change
	the nature of a game. Even small amounts of variability can stabilize
	cooperation by, for example, maintaining the need to deal with cheaters.
	Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction,

	negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than
	unconditional actions. Once there are mechanisms such as mutation
	and environmental influences that maintain variation within populations,
	whether cooperation evolves may depend on the variation in the cooperativeness
	trait. Variation means that it may be worth taking a chance that
	a partner is cooperative by being cooperative. When there are markets,
	so that individuals can break off interactions to seek a better partner,
	variation promotes choosiness and hence penalizes those uncooperative
	individuals, who are rejected. Variation promotes the need to monitor
	the previous behaviour of others, and once this social sensitivity

  abstract = {The "iterated prisoner's dilemma" is the most widely used model for
	the evolution of cooperation in biological societies. Here we show
	that a heterogeneous population consisting of simple strategies,
	whose behavior is totally specified by the outcome of the previous
	round, can lead to persistent periodic or highly irregular (chaotic)
	oscillations in the frequencies of the strategies and the overall
	level of cooperation. The levels of cooperation jump up and down
	in an apparently unpredictable fashion. Small recurrent and simultaneous
	invasion attempts (caused by mutation) can change the evolutionary
	dynamics from converging to an evolutionarily stable strategy to
	periodic oscillations and chaos. Evolution can be twisted away from
	defection, toward cooperation. Adding "generous tit-for-tat" greatly
	increases the overall level of cooperation and can lead to long periods
	of steady cooperation. Since May's paper [May, R. M. (1976) Nature
	(London) 261, 459-467], "simple mathematical models with very complicated
	dynamics" have been found in many biological applications, but here

  abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma is the leading metaphor for the evolution of
	cooperative behaviour in populations of selfish agents, especially
	since the well-known computer tournaments of Axelrod and their application
	to biological communities. In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy
	tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major
	paradigm for reciprocal altruism. Here we present extended evolutionary
	simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies
	including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success
	of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat
	and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift,
	which seems to be a widespread rule. Pavlov's success is based on
	two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional
	mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature
	prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional
	cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more
	robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in
	natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

	these strategies can (i) deterministically set her opponent Y's score,
	independently of his strategy or response, or (ii) enforce an extortionate
	linear relation between her and his scores. Against such a player,
	an evolutionary player's best response is to accede to the extortion.
	Only a player with a theory of mind about his opponent can do better,
	in which case Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is an Ultimatum Game.},

  volume = {82},

  abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences
	are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon
	covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty,
	willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study
	of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics,
	pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have
	examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation
	is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important
	influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that
	individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst
	animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament
	include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of
	the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence
	in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or
	different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament
	can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework
	and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for
	ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five
	major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, exploration-avoidance,
	activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not
	make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological
	processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary
	biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature
	reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and
	linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology
	and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement
	methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that
	would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity,
	conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

  __markedentry = {[Aaron:]},
  abstract = {How can cooperation be achieved between self-interested individuals
	in commonly-occurring asymmetric interactions where agents have different
	positions? Should agents use the same strategies that are appropriate
	for symmetric social situations? We explore these questions through
	the asymmetric interaction captured in the indeﬁnitely repeated investment
	game (IG). In every period of this game, the ﬁrst player decides
	how much of an endowment he wants to invest, then this amount is
	tripled and passed to the second player, who ﬁnally decides how much
	of the tripled investment she wants to return to the ﬁrst player.
	The results of three evolutionary studies demonstrate that the best-performing
	strategies for this asymmetric game differ from those for a similar
	but symmetric game, the indeﬁnitely repeated Prisoner’s dilemma game.
	The strategies that enable cooperation for the asymmetric IG react
	more sensitively to exploitation, meaning that cooperation can more
	easily break down. Furthermore, once cooperation has stopped, it
	is much more difﬁcult to reestablish than in symmetric situations.
	Based on these results, the presence of asymmetry in an interaction
	appears to be an important factor affecting adaptive behavior in
	these common social situations.},

  volume = {116},
  pages = {257--269},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that differences in life history may lead
	to consistent inter-individual variation in behavioural traits, so-called
	behavioural syndromes, animal personalities or temperaments. Consistencies
	of behaviours and behavioural syndromes have mainly been studied
	in non-cooperative species. Insights on the evolution of cooperation
	could be gained from studying individual differences in life histories
	and behavioural traits. Kin selection theory predicts that if an
	individual’s reproductive ability is low, it had to aim at gaining
	inclusive fitness benefits by helping others. We tested this prediction
	in the cooperatively breeding cichlid \emph{Neolamprologus pulcher},
	by assessing reproductive parameters of adults that had been tested
	earlier for aggressiveness and for their propensity to assist breeders
	when they had been young (`juveniles'). We found that juvenile aggression
	levels predicted the acceptance of a subordinate in the group when
	adult. Males which were aggressive as juveniles were significantly
	more likely to tolerate a subordinate in the group when compared
	with males which were peaceful as juveniles, whereas females which
	were more aggressive as juveniles tended to expel subordinates more
	often. Females produced significantly smaller clutches when paired
	to males which had helped more as a juvenile, despite the fact that
	adult males hardly provided direct brood care. There was no evidence
	that females with a high propensity to help when young, produced
	smaller clutches or eggs when adult, but they took longer to lay
	their first clutch when compared with females with a low propensity
	to help when young. These results suggest that variation in behavioural
	types might explain variation in cooperation, the extent of group-living
	and reproductive decisions.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {19},
  pages = {448--455},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {The study of nonhuman personality capitalizes on the fact that individuals
	of many species behave in predictable, variable, and quantifiable
	ways. Although a few empirical studies have examined the ultimate
	consequences of personality differences, there has been no synthesis
	of results. We conducted a formal meta-analysis of published studies
	reporting fitness consequences of single personality dimensions to
	identify general trends across species. We found bolder individuals
	had increased reproductive success, particularly in males, but incurred
	a survival cost, thus, supporting the hypothesis that variation in
	boldness was maintained due to a ``trade-off'' in fitness consequences
	across contexts. Potential mechanisms maintaining variation in exploration
	and aggression are not as clear. Exploration had a positive effect
	only on survival, whereas aggression had a positive effect on both
	reproductive success and, not significantly, on survival. Such results
	would suggest that selection is driving populations to become more
	explorative and aggressive. However, limitations in meta-analytic
	techniques preclude us from testing for the effects of fluctuating
	environmental conditions or other forms of selection on these dimensions.
	Results do, however, provide evidence for general relationships between
	personality and fitness, and we provide a framework for future studies
	to follow in the hopes of spurring more in-depth, long-term research
	into the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining variation in personality
	dimensions and overall behavioral syndromes. We conclude with a discussion
	on how understanding and managing personality traits may play a key
	role in the captive breeding and recovery programs of endangered
